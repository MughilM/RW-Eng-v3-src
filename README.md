# RW-Eng-v3

This repository holds extended research of a thematic fit model that has been trained using a multi-task residual role-filler approach. 

## Data and License
The corpus itself is available at: http://yuvalmarton.com/rw-eng/

The corpus contains documents coming from the British National Corpus (BNC) and ukWaC. Therefore, the license for using it is the same license as the ukWac ([CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode): summary, which is not instead of the license: attribute our work, share, adapt, whatever, just not for commercial use, and donâ€™t sue us for anything). The BNC no longer requires a license.

## Key Dependencies

- **Tested OS:** Ubuntu 18.04, Windows
- Python 3.7
- Tensorflow 2.4
- CUDA 11/10.1

Numerous problems were encountered using Python versions above 3.7 as well as Tensorflow 2.5. Instructions for setting up CUDA 11 and 10.1 on Ubuntu systems can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#install_cuda_with_apt) and [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20201207152356/https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) respectively.

## Setting Up

Once NVIDIA, CUDA, and cuDNN libraries are installed and verified with `nvidia-smi` and `nvcc --version`, run the following commands to set up and activate an Anaconda environment with our libraries.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MughilM/RW-Eng-v3-src.git
cd RW-Eng-v3-src
conda env create -f environments/capstoneenv_linux.yml
conda activate bloomberg-cu-capstone-2020
```

Make sure to select the correct environment file pertaining to your OS. This will create the `bloomberg` environment.

## Usage

Everything is run from `main.py`. We have included a small dataset of 1000 samples in `processed_data` called `v2` (The second argument is the `--data_version`). The `processed_data` folder is currently set as the data directory, which means **any dataset you wish to use needs to be moved to this folder**. Simply choose the model and dataset name, along with other optional parameters such as experiment name, epochs, etc. Experiments are saved to the `experiments` subfolder.

```bash
python main.py \
  v4 \
  v2 \
  --experiment_name test_exp \
  --epochs 15 \
  --batch_size 64 \
  --do_eval \
  --evaluation_tasks pado mcrae
```

This will train the MTRFv4Res model with 15 epochs and save under `test_exp`. It will also perform the Pado07 and McRae05 thematic fit evaluation tasks. Please see `models.py` to see a list of models currently implemented. The `PARAM_TO_MODEL` variable in `main.py` states which argument name maps to which model. Any extra models you wish to implement should extend `MTRFv4Res`, placed in `models.py`, and have `PARAM_TO_MODEL` updated.

### Only Evaluation

If evaluating on an already trained model is desired, then simply provide the experiment name and the `--eval_only` flag:

```bash
python main.py \
  v4 \
  v2 \
  --experiment_name test_exp \
  --eval_only \
  --evaluation_tasks all
```

Due to the very last flag, this will run ALL the thematic fit evaluation tasks.
